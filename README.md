SkinSense Pro – a personalized skincare app is finally complete!

The idea for this app came to life during our Software Architecture course, and now it’s a reality.

What It Offers:

Barcode Scanning: Instantly analyze product ingredients.

Personalized Recommendations: Tailored to your skin type and concerns.

Liked Products: Save and manage your favorite skincare items.

Seamless Shopping: Purchase products from trusted distributors.


This project wouldn’t have been possible without the incredible efforts of Ahsan Habib Niloy and Kareena Zaman. We worked as a team, each contributing to turn this idea into a fully functional app.

Developed using Android Studio (Java/XML) with Firebase for real-time data and secure authentication, SkinSense Pro is designed to simplify skincare decisions for users.
